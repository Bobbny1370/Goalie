    <!-- About Us -->
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to Pad Stackers, where passion meets opportunity on the ice. 
    </p>

    <p>
        At Pad Stackers, we believe in breaking down barriers. Hockey 
		shouldn't be exclusive; it should be a chance for every aspiring 
		player to thrive. My coaching philosophy is rooted in the belief 
		that financial constraints should never hinder someone's pursuit 
		of excellence on the ice. I've witnessed firsthand the impact of 
		missed opportunities due to financial constraints, and I'm 
		committed to ensuring that every dedicated player gets the chance 
		they deserve.
    </p>

    <p>
        In addition to affordability, I value the potential in every 
		player. I've seen instances where coaches overlooked talented 
		individuals, simply because they didn't fit a predetermined 
		mold for higher-level play. At Pad Stackers, we believe that 
		everyone deserves a chance to develop and improve, regardless 
		of initial assessments. Every player, no matter their skill 
		level, deserves the opportunity to reach their full potential.
    </p>

    <p>
        Join Pad Stackers, where we're not just coaching goalies; 
		we're fostering a community where passion, dedication, and 
		opportunity converge to shape the future of hockey.
    </p>
